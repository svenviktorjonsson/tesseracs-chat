This file tells Docker, "When you build the image, do not include any of these files or folders." This is a standard and essential practice for creating clean, stable Docker images.

#### Step 2: How to See the Logs

From now on, if your application isn't loading, you can see exactly what's happening inside the container by using this command.

1.  Stop the current process by pressing `Ctrl+C`.
2.  Run the application again with the standard command:
    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build
    ```
3.  If it seems to be frozen or not working, open a **second terminal**, navigate to your project directory, and run:
    ```bash
    docker-compose logs -f app
